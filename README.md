The first ever rubik's clock solver that generates optimal tick count solutions!
You can use this by doing !matrixclock with Clock Bot but here is the code if you want to run it yourself.

How to use:
- download the project
- you also need to download the pinSets.bin file. It is too large for github (1.2 gb). You can downloaod it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jVptOQLLyB1LGELG9MsAeoNVnyPhJBDr/view?usp=sharing
- put that file in the src folder
- cd into the src folder
- run "cargo run --release" in the command line (you need to be in the src folder for this to work)

lmk if you need help running it!
